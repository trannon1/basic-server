The UMP is a blowback-operated select-fire submachine gun firing from a closed bolt. It features a polymer stock that is able to be folded for compactness, a paddle-style magazine release, and a handguard that is able to accept accessories, such as vertical foregrips. The barrel is approximately 8 inches long, and there may be rails on top of the receiver to mount optics.

                As originally designed, the UMP is chambered for larger cartridges (.45 ACP and .40 S&W) than other submachine guns like the MP5, to provide more stopping power against unarmored targets (with slightly lower effectiveness at longer range) than the MP5 (largely offered in 9×19mm, albeit with short-lived production of 10mm Auto and .40 S&W variants). A larger cartridge produces more recoil, and makes control more difficult in fully automatic firing. To mitigate this, the cyclic rate of fire was reduced to 600 rounds/min, which makes it one of the slower firing submachine guns on the market.</h1></a>

              <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/M4A1.png" alt="" class="showhim" /><h1 class="showme">The M4 carbine is a shorter and lighter variant of the M16A2 assault rifle. The M4 is a 5.56×45mm NATO, air-cooled, direct impingement gas-operated, magazine-fed carbine. It has a 14.5 in (370 mm) barrel and a telescoping stock.The M4 is capable of firing in semi-automatic and three-round burst (like the M16A2 and M16A4), while the M4A1 is capable of firing in semi-auto and full automatic (like the M16A1 and M16A3).

                The M4A1 carbine is a fully automatic variant of the basic M4 carbine intended for special operations use. The M4A1 has a "S-1-F" (safe/semi-automatic/fully automatic) trigger group, while the M4 has a "S-1-3" (safe/semi-automatic/3-round burst) trigger group. The M4A1 is used by almost all U.S special operation units including, but not limited to, Marine Force Recon, Army Rangers, Army Special Forces, Navy SEALs, United States Air Force Pararescue and Air Force Combat Control Teams. The M4A1 is especially favored by counter-terrorist and special forces units for close quarters combat and urban warfare because of the carbine's compact firepower. It has a maximum effective range of about 500 to 600 meters (550–660 yd).
                
                Conversion of M4s to the M4A1 began in 2014, the start of all U.S. Army forces being equipped with the automatic variant. Though in service with special forces, combat in Afghanistan showed the need for providing automatic suppression fires during fire and movement for regular soldiers. The 101st Airborne Division began fielding new-built M4A1s in 2012, and the U.S. 1st Infantry Division became the first unit to convert their M4s to M4A1-standard in May 2014.</h1> </a>

              <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/ST_AR-15.png" alt="" class="showhim" /><h1 class="showme">An AR-15 variant refers to a lightweight, intermediate cartridge magazine-fed, air-cooled semi-automatic rifle with a rotating lock bolt, actuated by direct impingement gas-operation or long/short stroke piston operation. The term "AR-15" signifies "Armalite rifle, design 15".The trademark "AR15" or "AR-15" is registered to Colt, which requires the term to be used only to refer to their products. Colt uses "AR-15" for its semi-automatic civilian rifles and thus many use the term only for Colt AR-15s and clones made by other manufacturers.

                Other manufacturers make AR-15 clones and variants marketed under separate designations, although these are frequently referred to as AR-15s. The prototype AR-15 rifle was designed by ArmaLite as a selective fire weapon for military purposes. Armalite sold the design to Colt due to financial difficulties. After some modifications, the rifle eventually became the US Army's M16 rifle. A civilian version was marketed as the Colt AR-15 rifle.
                
                Because AR-15 receivers and parts are widely manufactured, the weapon is considered extremely modular and adaptable to a variety of different functions, uses, and firing performances. Various receivers and barrels in a wide array of calibers allow the AR-15 to function at many different ranges and in a number of varying roles. Many aftermarket parts can provide the rifle with a tactical feel, with options ranging from picatinny rails to MLOK allowing different accessories to be mounted on the rifle.</h1> </a>

              <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/HK416.png" alt="" class="showhim" /><h1 class="showme">During a collaboration between the US Army Delta Force R&D department with the German fire arm company H&K, an European variant of the AR-15 platform of assault rifles was born. The new carbine project was originally named HK M4, later on changed to HK416 after law suit filed by Colt Defense regarding trademark infringement.

                Primarily chambered with the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge, HK416 is a short-stroke gas piston operated, rotating bolt, selective fire carbine. Feeding on standard issue NATO STANAG magazines HK416 is able achieve a rate of fire of 700-900 rounds per minute, default iron sight provides an effective firing range of 300 metres.
                
                416 features Picatinny rail placements all over the gun, top of the receiver, top/side/bottom of the barrel forearm. Compatible with and able to attach all forms of combat accessories of NATO member states, the rail forearm does not come in contact with the barrel, the barrel is "free-floating" in effort to improve accuracy. Bottom rails can mount accessories such as a fore-grip or a 40mm grenade launcher (usually the AG36/M320 style), while the side rails for tactical lights/laser and/or other combat accessories. The weapon also features a folding front Iron sight paired with a rear sight similar to that of a G3, the operator can make use of it should they not wish to mount optics.
                
                The HK416 may be visually similar to that of a AR-15 rifle, it features several technology innovations of H&K, their HK50, XM8 and L85A2 projects has provided valuable experience in the development of HK416. Different from the other AR-15 derivatives with the direct impingement mechanism, HK416 uses the proprietary short-stroke piston mechanism developed by H&K, which was derived from G36. Other minor features includes newly designed adjustable telescopic butt stock and pistol grip to improve user comfort.
                
                Military/policing units all over the world are adapting the HK416 (Variants or derivatives) into their arsenal due to it's undeniable reliability, performance and modularity. Starting with the Norwegian army (HK416N), United States special operation groups such as Delta Force and DEVGRU SEALs has also followed the foot step and replaced their M4A1 out of service with the HK416, French army is also planning on gradually replacing their FAMAS F1 with the HK416F.[1] For various reasons, HK416 (likely due to the tremendous cost of replacing a service rifle) had yet to replace G36/HK50 as the main service rifle of Bundeswehr, however Bundeswehr had purchased an amount of HK416A5 rifles and given the designation G38 for them[2], likely for the use of their elite units.</h1> </a>
